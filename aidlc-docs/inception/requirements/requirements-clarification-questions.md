# Requirements Clarification Questions

I detected an ambiguity in your response that needs clarification:

## Ambiguity 1: Point Allocation Method
Your response to Q3 mentioned both "每月每个员工都有固定的allocation" (fixed monthly allocation) and "管理员也可以手动调整" (admin manual adjustment). This combines two different approaches.

### Clarification Question 1
How should the point allocation system work?

A) Fixed monthly allocation ONLY (same amount to all employees each month)
B) Fixed monthly allocation PLUS admin can manually add/subtract additional points
C) No automatic allocation - admin manually distributes all points
D) Fixed monthly allocation with admin ability to override the monthly amount for specific employees
E) Other (please describe after [Answer]: tag below)

[Answer]: D
